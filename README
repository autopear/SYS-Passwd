Change password for root and mobile on jailbroken iOS devices.

Support iPhone and iPad, firmware above 3.0.


Rename "SYS Passwd" after compilation to "SYS_Passwd" and copy it to the deb package's work place.

Copy "SYS Passwd" under project's directory to deb package's work place.

Give executable permission to both "SYS Passwd" and "SYS_Passwd".

As the app must be as root, you need to set sticky permission to "SYS_Passwd".

Use these commands:
	chmod +x SYS_Passwd "SYS Passwd"
	chmod +s SYS_Passwd
	

The code to change password is obtained and modified from:
